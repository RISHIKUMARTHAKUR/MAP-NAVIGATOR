# MAP-NAVIGATOR

1. Developed a C++-based map navigator using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to compute the shortest path between user-specified nodes.
2. Utilized adjacency lists and priority queues for optimal graph representation and traversal efficiency.
3. Built the project using Visual Studio Code and version-controlled with GitHub for collaborative development and versioning.
4. Demonstrated real-world application of graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving in route optimization.
